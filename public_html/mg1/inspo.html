                <p> my inspiration for the keyframe animation came from the time stamp in the video but i think the entire thing is cool animaton </p>

                <p> if you haven't watched bad apple, you're missing out... there are a lot of cool transitions in this video that i really like, and i think the monochrome colors really add a lot to the style. i'm pretty sure it's a 3d animation as well </p>

                <p> the zenless zone zero login screen screen is much more interesting in comparison to hoyoverse's other login screens, having intricately animated custom commercials for the telivision. they have so many damn commercials that i have 8 minutes of inspiration to use for motion graphics thanks to them.</p>

                <p> cartoon network has cool dynamic motion graphics used in their logo very cool</p>

                <p> another hoyoverse game. great. this time honkai star rail doesn't have a unique login screen but instead has a unique logo animation at the end of every character's trailer. i chose this because i like how they incorporate the aspects of the character into the logo design and animation. </p>

                <p> this logo always scared me as a kid, but i chose it because it was one of the first things i thought of for my logo animation. the actual logo animation i did has little to nothing to do with this one, but it has some aspects incorporated in it. </p>
            </figure>

                <p> ann sent me this terrible video but it has some motion graphics in it so that's nice </p>
            </figure>

                <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/udiDAYzMRmA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <p> i chose this video because the motion graphics are very satisfying to me, and i want to create something as chaotic as this video at some point. not to mention i also like the song so it made me want to use this for inspiration even more,,,</p>
                <p> if anyone other than bruce is seeing this please note that I DON'T LIKE ROBLOX FORSAKEN. I ONLY LIKE THE MUSIC. OK. </p>

                <p> i lost the original video for this section but i decided to replace it with a classic!! that bruce doesn't know about probably. i like this video because it uses a lot of simple motion graphics when they're animating the lyrics, ones that i could potentially use myself.</p>

                <p> i was watching/listening to this video on loop while i was working on this website, and then i realized... i can use this for my inspiration! there are a lot of interesting graphics here yes... most are very complex, but i still would like to make a parody of this music video someday! </p>
